RethinkDB adapter for Laravel (with Eloquent support)

God bless @jenssegers for his great laravel-mongodb project. I have used his tests and some other code, since it's awesome codebase for supporting other NoSQL databases. I hope he won't be angry on me for that ;)

This project is aiming at Laravel 5 which is soon to be released, so it might not work with L4.
